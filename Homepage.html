                    I've had a good experience in cooking, especially asian foods including; fried rice (with packaged seasonings), eggs in different forms( american diger omelette, french omlette, ),

                <p>
                    Drawing has been one of the closest and oldest skill I've ever explored in my life, I started doing art professionally back in 2019 when I started my youtube channel, 
                    It didn't quite go well considering I was still at elementary and my schedule got even tighter as I went to high school. My artstyle improved drastically as I went out 
                    of boarding school and was heavily influenced by animes such as gurren lagann which peaked my interest due to their approach towards character design.

                    I started getting into programming seriously in high school where I studied the basic foundational languages of web development with freecodecamp while getting to know stuff
                    about cyber-security as well from my close friend at the time.

                    I started taking language learning seriously in the first year of high school when I've decided that france, china, singapore and japan will be on the list of universities I'll
                    apply.

                    I was in my first year in high school and I wanted to try something I've always wanted to do deep in my heart which was to become a scientist so I thought I'd start doing
                    research and what better way to do it than getting other people involved. And so I started a research club with my math teacher as our supervisor.

                <p>
                    My first research paper involved cognitive neuroscience, psychology and philosophy if i'm not mistaken, and it's about life-long performance which aims to find ways we could
